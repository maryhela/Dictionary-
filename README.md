# Dictionary-
This is an Engineering Dictionary program that stores 30 terms using a Python dictionary. It takes user input, converts it to uppercase, and searches for the term. If found, it displays the definition; otherwise, it shows "Term not found." This makes the program simple, efficient, and easy to use.
